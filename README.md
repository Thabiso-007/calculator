Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.

## Introduction

A calculator is an app that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. Basic calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication and division mathematical calculations.

## Installing the project

Alright, to make sure everything goes smoothly, it's crucial to have nodejs installed on your machine. Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript outside of a web browser. It's pretty neat! Once you've got that covered, open up your terminal (you know, that black box where you type in commands) and get ready for the next step. Just type in `npm install` and hit enter! This command will initiate the installation process of all the necessary packages and dependencies required by your project. Npm stands for "Node Package Manager," which is an incredibly handy tool for managing external libraries and modules in JavaScript projects. So sit back, relax, and let npm handle all the heavy lifting for you!
